# Research Document: Usability Testing of Nelo’s Kitchen

## Summary of the Study
This research study was all about understanding how people interact with **Nelo’s Kitchen**, a website prototype designed to help users explore and recreate Nigerian recipes. The goal was to figure out what works well and what could be improved, especially when it comes to navigating the site, finding recipes, and understanding Nigerian dish names. We also wanted to see how users felt about separating blog content from the recipes themselves.

We had **5 participants** with different backgrounds—some were frequent cooks, others were just starting out, and a few weren’t familiar with Nigerian cuisine at all. They were asked to complete tasks like finding a pastry recipe, moving between categories, and sharing their thoughts on the blog-recipe separation. After the tasks, they filled out a quick survey to rate their overall experience.

## Most Rewarding Aspects
1. **Actionable Feedback**: Participants gave really helpful suggestions, like making buttons more obvious and paying more attention to naming systems as in varying cultures, different word convey very different meanings.
2. **Cultural Insights**: Non-Nigerian participants pointed out that some dish names were hard to understand, which led to the idea of adding short descriptions to make things clearer.
3. **Blog Separation Love**: The decision to keep blogs and recipes separate was a hit! People loved not having to scroll through long stories to get to the recipe.
4. **High Satisfaction**: Overall, participants were pretty happy with the site. They found it easy to use, visually appealing, and well-organized.

## Interesting Facts Discovered
1. **"Entrees" Confusion**: Some participants, especially Nigerians, did not know what "Entrees" meant. They suggested using "Main Dishes" instead.
2. **Spacing Issues**: The extra white space made some people think there weren’t many recipes on the site. Turns out, less space might actually make the site feel more packed with content.
3. **Cultural Differences**: Non-Nigerians found the dish names a bit tricky. Adding a short description could help make things clearer for everyone.
4. **Missed Navigation Buttons**: A few participants did not notice the navigation buttons at the bottom of the page. Moving them higher up could make them easier to find. As someone who typically scrolled to the bottom of the page, observing that most people did as a matter of fact not do not spend that much time on a website was shocking. 
5. **Blog Order**: While people liked the blog-recipe separation, some suggested showing the blog first to encourage users to read it before jumping straight to the recipe.

- **Location**: Canada.
- **When**: January 17-24, 2025.
- **Who**: 5 participants (3 women, 2 men) aged 18–60, with different cooking habits and cultural backgrounds.

### What Participants Did

- **Task 2: Navigate from Pastries to Entrees**
- **Task 3: Thoughts on Blog-Recipe Separation**
- **Task 4: Overall Experience**

### Survey Results
After the tasks, participants rated the site on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree). Here’s how it went:

| Question | Participant 1 | Participant 2 | Participant 3 | Participant 4 | Participant 5 |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|-------|--------|

## Themes, Insights, and Recommendations

### **1. Navigation and Usability**
- **Insight**: Participants found the navigation buttons helpful but often missed the ones at the bottom of the page. Some were confused by terms like "Entrees" and "Menu."
- **Recommendation**:
  - Make navigation buttons more visible by moving them higher on the page.
  - Replace "Entrees" with "Main Dishes" to avoid confusion, especially for Nigerian users.

### **2. Dish Names and Cultural Accessibility**
- **Insight**: Non-Nigerian participants struggled with unfamiliar dish names, which made it harder for them to choose recipes.
- **Recommendation**:
  - Add short descriptions to dish names to help users understand what they’re looking at.
  - Consider grouping dishes by type (e.g., "Spicy," "Vegetarian") to make browsing easier.

### **3. Blog and Recipe Separation**
- **Insight**: Participants loved the separation of blog and recipe content but suggested showing the blog first to encourage engagement.
- **Recommendation**:
  - Reverse the order so the blog appears before the recipe. This could encourage users to read the blog before diving into the recipe.

### **4. Visual Design and Layout**
- **Insight**: While the site was visually appealing, some participants felt the sign-up page design was random.
- **Recommendation**:
  - Revisit the sign-up page design to make it more cohesive with the rest of the site.

### **5. Spacing and Content Perception**
- **Insight**: Excessive white space led some participants to believe there were fewer recipes available than there actually were.
- **Recommendation**:
  - Reduce white space to make the site feel more content-rich.
  - Add visual cues (e.g., "Scroll for more") to indicate that there’s more content below.

### What We Learned
The study gave us a lot of great insights! While people generally liked the site, there are a few areas we can improve:
- **Navigation**: Make buttons more visible and clarify terms like "Entrees."
- **Spacing**: Reduce white space so users know there’s more content.
- **Dish Names**: Add short descriptions for non-Nigerian users.
- **Blog Order**: Consider showing the blog before the recipe to encourage engagement.

Overall, the feedback was really positive, and we’ve got a solid foundation to build on. The next steps will be tweaking the design and layout based on what we’ve learned to make Nelo’s Kitchen even better!
